  Separated by commas.
* `installFiles` - A list of files which should be exclusively installed.
  This complements `installDirs` and `installExt`. Only the files listed
  here, directories listed in `installDirs`, files which share the extension
  listed in `installExt`, the `.nimble` file and the binary (if `bin` or `namedBin`
  is specified) will be installed. Separated by commas.

  **Default**: The directory in which the `.nimble` file resides; i.e.

  Nimble will build the files specified and install them appropriately.
